# MyHashtab
Implementation of the hashtable structure and analysis of its algorithms.

## Definition
A hash table is a data structure that stores all elements as a key-value pair.
Basic operations on a hash table: search, add, delete. The principle of operation is as follows:
to access an element, we use a hash function. The hash function turns the key
of the element into an index, which is the orientation in the hash table.
